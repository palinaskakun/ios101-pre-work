Submitted by: **Palina Skakun**

**IOS101-Prework Project** is an app that has three labels and a button. When the button is pressed, it changes the background of the app to a random color.

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] Users see a screen with three labels that includes personal information about the developer and a background change button.
* [x] Clicking the button changes the screen color to a random color.

The following **optional** features can be implemented in the future:
- Improve the UI by using different fonts/colors/background
- Feel free to play around with other elements, such as image views, textfields, etc.
- Iplement a way to change the color of the text as well

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

<!--Make a list of your favorite 3-5 applications and identify 2-3 features that make them your favorite app. Its okay if features repeat on different apps
Example App: Instagram
Changing the background color of the messages screen
Deleting old messages
 Think of an app idea that you would like to build. It can be a new idea or an improvement on an existing app. Write a short paragraph describing the app and the features you would like to implement. You are not commiting to this idea, but it helps to start brain storming early on and get feedback from your peers and instructors. -->

 

## Notes

I have not encountered any challenges, except not being very familiar with Swift, so I spent most of the time reading the documentation and familiarizing myself with syntax.
